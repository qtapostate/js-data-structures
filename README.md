# JS Data Structures

This is a practice project for making various data structures using Typescript.
JS obviously isn't the best language to use for this, due to lack of tight control over memory and pointers, but it's useful knowledge nonetheless.

For this project I have only a few rules to constrain myself:
1. no dependencies other than development dependencies needed for testing.
2. no use of `class` syntax - only functional programming!
3. everything must have test suites close to 90% coverage - all edge cases should be covered.

Included in this project are (or will be) the following data structures:
* `LinkedList`
 
Still a work in progress:
* Data Structures
  * `DoublyLinkedList` (WIP)
  * `Stack` (WIP)
  * `Queue` (WIP)
  * `DirectedGraph` (WIP)
  * `UndirectedGraph` (WIP)
  * `NAryTree` (WIP)
  * `BalancedTree` (WIP)
  * `BinaryTree` (WIP)
  * `BinarySearchTree` (WIP)
  * `AVLTree` (WIP)
  * `RedBlackTree` (WIP)
  * `TwoThreeTree` (WIP)
  * `Trie` (WIP)
  * `HashTable` (WIP)
  * ... probably more that i'll think of adding later
 
* Algorithms
  * Graph: Breadth-First Search (WIP)
  * Graph: Depth-First Search (WIP)
  * ... probably more by the time i get around to it.
